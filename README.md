# Weather ⛅

A site able to show the climate of a city chosen by users. In this process, it changes the background image to one of the city, just as it displays its country's flag.

In **JavaScript**, some tags/concepts worth mentioning are:

* Fetch API
* Events

As for **CSS**, these are some of the interesting ones:

* Responsive Design
* Animations
* Grid

**API's** that made this possible:

* https://openweathermap.org/api
* https://flagsapi.com
* https://unsplash.com/developers

<br>

**Notice:** To make it work, you'll need to sign up for the Open Weather API and get an access key. This key must be inserted into *scripts.js*, line number 1.

Keep in mind that in order for the key to be fully activated, you'll have to wait a few hours.

The project originates from this free course on Youtube:
* www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnDvRpP8BneysKU8KivhnrVaKpILD3gZ6 - **kudos to teacher Matheus** ❤️

Instead of just copying what would be instructed, I analyzed the final result and, in order to reproduce it, developed the application by myself.
